Online Sabacc is a re-implementation of my original Sabacc application, but
web-based (using Django). Don't be surprised if it doesn't work yet. 

The original application that I forked from can be found at the following
URLs:

About Sabacc
============

Sabacc is a card game originally from the Star Wars universe. It is similar
to Blackjack except it employs a random element where any card may change
value at any point during the game.

For more information on Sabacc, see the website at
<http://sabacc.sourceforge.net/>. A useful website that fully explains the
rules as adopted in this game is <http://www.pagat.com/invented/sabacc.html>.
Please note: all of these rules have been adopted in the game, apart from the
static field. Currently, no card may be made exempt from the Sabacc Shift.
