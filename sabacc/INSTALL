Installing Sabacc
=================

To install Sabacc, change to the directory where you unpacked the
source tarball, then type (as root):

python setup.py install

Alternatively, you can run Sabacc from the extracted tarball archive. 
Simply type ./bin/sabacc from the correct directory. Please note that if 
a different version of Sabacc is already installed on your system, 
running Sabacc in this way may cause problems. In this case it is always 
best to install Sabacc using the setup.py script.

If you are a user of Debian/Ubuntu or Microsoft Windows, you might want 
to consider installing the relevant .deb or .exe version of Sabacc 
instead. These are both available from http://sabacc.sourceforge.net and 
make the process of installing and running Sabacc relatively 
hassle-free.
