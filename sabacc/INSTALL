Installing Sabacc
=================

Before attempting to run or install Sabacc, first ensure that you have 
all the correct dependencies (see below). If you have decided to install
pygtkmvc locally, you may need to run the following command before Sabacc
will work:
   sed -i 's@from model_mt import@#from model_mt import@' \
   sabacc/front/guiInterface/gtkmvc/__init__.py

Now, to install Sabacc, change to the directory where you unpacked the
source tarball, then type (as root):

python setup.py install

Alternatively, you can run Sabacc from the extracted tarball archive. 
Simply type 'python ./bin/sabacc --local' from the correct directory.

If you are a user of Debian/Ubuntu or Microsoft Windows, you might want 
to consider installing the relevant .deb or .exe version of Sabacc 
instead. These are both available from http://sabacc.sourceforge.net and 
make the process of installing and running Sabacc relatively 
hassle-free.


Requirements
============

You will need the following software installed to run Sabacc:

  - Python (>= 2.5) - http://www.python.org/
  - The lxml.etree library (>=1.3.6) - http://codespeak.net/lxml/

To use the GTK GUI, you will also need the following:
  - GTK+ (>= 2.8) - http://www.gtk.org/
  - PyGTK (>= 2.8) - http://www.pygtk.org/
  - pygtkmvc (>= 1.2.2) - http://pygtkmvc.sourceforge.net/
    If you do not have this installed system-wide, you may download
    the tarball and extract into the sabacc/front/guiInterface/gtkmvc
    directory.
