Installing Sabacc
=================

To install Sabacc, change to the directory where you unpacked the
source tarball, then type (as root):

python setup.py install

Alternatively, you can run Sabacc from the extracted tarball archive. 
Simply type 'python ./bin/sabacc local' from the correct directory.

If you are a user of Debian/Ubuntu or Microsoft Windows, you might want 
to consider installing the relevant .deb or .exe version of Sabacc 
instead. These are both available from http://sabacc.sourceforge.net and 
make the process of installing and running Sabacc relatively 
hassle-free.

  - Python (>= 2.4) - http://www.python.org/
