About Sabacc
============

Sabacc is a card game originally from the Star Wars universe. It is similar
to Blackjack except it employs a random element where any card may change
value at any point during the game.

For more information on Sabacc, see the website at
<http://sabacc.sourceforge.net/>. A useful website that fully explains the
rules as adopted in this game is <http://www.pagat.com/invented/sabacc.html>.
Please note: all of these rules have been adopted in the game, apart from the
static field. Currently, no card may be made exempt from the Sabacc Shift.

Known Issues
============
  - It is currently not possible to add a computer player to the game 
    using the GUI interface without using a mouse. If you are unable to
    use a mouse, you will need to run Sabacc with the --no-gui option.
  - The text-based interface is currently not very stable and may do 
    some strange things. If you can, it is best to use the GUI 
    interface.
