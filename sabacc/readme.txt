SabaccApp readme:
-----------------

SabaccApp requires Python >2.4, The GTK+ runtime environment >2.0, PyGTK 
and NumPy. Although it should work on any platform, it has only been tested 
on Unix-based systems.

To run SabaccApp's GUI, call sabaccApp.py from the correct directory. To 
run the rudimentary text version of SabaccApp (only creation of 
WinLossAgents and agent training is fully implemented), call 
sabaccAppTxt.py from the correct directory.
