Sabacc readme:
--------------

Sabacc requires Python >2.4, The GTK+ runtime environment >2.0 and 
PyGTK. Although it should work on any platform, it has only been tested 
on Unix-based systems.

To run SabaccApp's GUI, call sabacc.py from the correct directory. To 
run the rudimentary text version of SabaccApp (only creation of 
WinLossAgents and agent training is fully implemented), call 
sabaccTxt.py from the correct directory.
