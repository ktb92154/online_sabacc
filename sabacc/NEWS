0.6beta1 (01 Feb 2008)
======================

New Features
------------

  - Back End:

    - An ante/buy-in has been added to the game. This goes into
      both pots. If a player cannot afford the ante, he/she is
      kicked out of the game.

    - An initial round of betting has been added to the game.
      This round takes place after the game has begun but before
      the cards are revealed.

    - The end-game winning conditions have been modified to make
      them fit in more easily with the rules on the website. The
      new 'Sudden Demise' rule has been added, but may be switched
      on or off by modifying the sabacc.back.settings module.

    - A player drawing a card and having a new total over 23 or
      under -23 will now not bomb out until the game is called.

    - A 'Sabacc Shift' feature has been added to the game. Now,
      a random number of cards will be changed at random points
      during the game. This can happen at any stage, even mid-turn.

    - Computer agents are now capable of betting with a reasonable
      degree of intelligence.


  - Front End:

    - The game now supports multiple human agents in the same game.
      If there are multiple humans in the same game, there will be a
      pause between turns and a player's cards will only be shown
      during his/her turn.


Bug Fixes
---------

  - Calling a game during the betting round will now not end the
    player's turn.

  - Multiple bugs involving players leaving the game and clicking
    the 'Quit Game' button have been fixed.

  - A number of bugs involving the end of the game and bomb outs
    have been fixed.


Miscellaneous
-------------

  - All LearningAgent-related features have been removed to speed
    the transition from academic project to playable game. The
    project no longer depends on NumPy.

  - The project has been renamed from SabaccApp to Sabacc. Some
    files have been renamed and others moved. Some text has been
    changed.

  - A setup script has been added to ease installation.
